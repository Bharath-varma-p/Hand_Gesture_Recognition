# Hand_Gesture_Recognition
A simple CNN project for detecting american sign language.
Here, I have implemented CNN (Convolution Neural Network) using Keras.

### Tools Used
1. Python 3
2. OpenCV 3
3. Tensorflow
4. Keras

### Running this project
1. Install Python 3, Opencv 3, Tensorflow, Keras.
2. First Train the model.
    ```
    python cnn_model.py
    ```
2. Now to test the model you just need to run recognise.py . To do so just open the terminal and run following command.
    ```
    python recognise.py
    ```
    Adjust the hsv values from the track bar to segment your hand color.

3. To create your own data set.
    ```
    python capture.py
    ```
# About the project
This project is to solve the basic communication Problem between Deaf-mute and Normal Person,(Each gesture in sign language means a specific meaning.)

This Project provides us with a user friendly way of communication with the computer which is more familiar to human beings
This Project is built using CNN - (convolutional neural network) for 
recognition(taining), 
The Programming Language used in this project is Python
